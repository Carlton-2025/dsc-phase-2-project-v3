# Phase 2 Project 
## Overview
The movie industry is a high risk, high reward type of business. To conduct business in the industry will require proper market research in order to know which type of sector to invest in.The best practice is to conduct research using data from different data companies in the market.Proper market research will probably tell us where is the majority of the market actual profitable and how business is supposed to be conducted. This will tell us probably whether we will want to take the same stand or even pick another.

## Business Understanding

The company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## The Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of the data
For this particular project, we will use the data sets provided to us to conduct our analysis.

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)

### Description of the Data

* In our files we have the Box Office Mojo data set together with the Numbers data set which are used by movie companies as the financial sources of the data whereas the IMDb data set is used to provide a rich layer of audience sentiment while provides a rich layer of audience sentiment while Rotten Tomatoes offers a metric for critical and audience consensus and the Movie Database stores general information and is used to identify franchises.
### Visualisation
* For this project, we made some visuals to describe the data after data cleaning. 
* We needed to first know if the industry was even lucrative to begin with and made the following plot

* We also needed to show which audience is being targeted by the movie industry

* We then had to show which genre did the industry target

* We then had to also show the runtimes of films to advice on how long they should last

## Conclusion
Since we were able to conduct proper analysis using the data, the project was a success.For this, the head of the movie studio is advised as follows:
### Recommendations
1. The company should venture into  drama,comedy,action and adventure.
2. The company should lean towards making the movies R rated.
3. The company should strive to ensure their movies last 90-100 minutes.
